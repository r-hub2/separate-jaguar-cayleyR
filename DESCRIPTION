Description: Implements algorithms for analyzing Cayley graphs of permutation groups,
    with a focus on the TopSpin puzzle and similar permutation-based combinatorial
    puzzles. Provides methods for cycle detection, state space exploration,
    bidirectional BFS pathfinding, and finding optimal operation sequences
    in permutation groups generated by shift and reverse operations.
    Includes C++ implementations of core operations via 'Rcpp' for performance.
    Optional GPU acceleration via 'ggmlR' Vulkan backend for batch distance
    calculations and parallel state transformations.
